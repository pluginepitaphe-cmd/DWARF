## What is DWARF?

DWARF replaces most of a transformer's attention layers with **DSQG** (Dyadic Sparse Q-K Gather) layers that attend to a fixed set of 44 sparse offsets — a dense local window plus semi-dyadic long-range taps. Because the offset set is fixed regardless of sequence length, each DSQG layer's KV cache at inference is a fixed-size circular buffer: **O(1) memory, not O(N)**.

One standard full causal attention layer remains, providing global context binding that sparse offsets alone cannot supply. The two layer types co-train from initialization: gradient signal from the full attention layer teaches the DSQG layers what to preprocess for it. This co-training is load-bearing — the preprocessing advantage is zero at epoch 1 and emerges entirely through joint training.

**condM** is the baseline hybrid: DSQG layers with ALiBi-style position biases and causal interference pooling.

**condU** extends condM with a physics-derived stack: Q-weighted scale gains (matched-filter retrieval), per-head IF amplifier gains, and Huygens-principle K/V injection at interference layers. These additions are derived from six signal-processing frameworks — heterodyne receivers, IF amplifiers, Huygens principle, matched filtering, phase-locked loops, and coherent field retrieval — that describe the same computational operations the architecture performs.

## Results

### Headline numbers

| Model | Params | Test PPL | Passkey mean | Benchmark mean |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Standard 13M | 21.6M | 64.07 | -- | 31.3% |
| condM 13M | 14.0M | 52.88 | 46.7% (5-sample) | 32.0% |
| condU 13M | 14.1M | 52.24 | 38.3% (50-sample) | 31.7% |
| Standard 85M | 101.4M | 39.45 | -- | 31.5% |
| condU 35M hybrid | 38.7M | 38.54 | 85.0% (5-sample) | 32.6% |
| condM 85M | 88.3M | 36.04 | -- | 32.5% |

Passkey task: next-word prediction of a memorized key buried in a 2048-token context, evaluated at 12 retrieval distances (d=1..1536). 50-sample measurements are reported where available; 5-sample results carry high variance and are noted.

Benchmark mean: average accuracy across HellaSwag, PIQA, ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge, WinoGrande, and LAMBADA.

**condM 85M** (88.3M params) beats the standard 85M baseline (101.4M params) by **3.4 PPL** with **13% fewer parameters**. The condU 35M hybrid (38.7M params) beats the standard 85M on benchmark accuracy (32.6% vs 31.5%) at 62% fewer parameters.

### External benchmark detail (6-task suite)

| Model | PPL | HellaSwag | PIQA | ARC-E | ARC-C | WinoGrande | LAMBADA | Mean |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Standard 13M | 64.07 | 24.9% | 54.3% | 30.4% | 19.7% | 52.3% | 6.3% | 31.3% |
| condM 13M | 52.88 | 24.5% | 55.9% | 34.0% | 20.1% | 51.1% | 6.2% | 32.0% |
| condU 13M | 52.24 | 24.5% | 54.1% | 33.3% | 21.1% | 50.0% | 7.4% | 31.7% |
| Standard 85M | 39.45 | 24.9% | 54.9% | 28.9% | 18.4% | 52.2% | 9.8% | 31.5% |
| condU 35M hybrid | 38.54 | 24.7% | 56.3% | 34.6% | 18.1% | 50.7% | 10.9% | 32.6% |
| condM 85M | 36.04 | 25.1% | 55.0% | 31.2% | 19.7% | 51.1% | 13.0% | 32.5% |

All 13M models cluster within 1.6% mean benchmark accuracy regardless of PPL or passkey. LAMBADA is the exception: it is the only task in the suite sensitive to memory mechanism type at 13M scale, because it requires content-addressed lookup to predict the final word of a passage from earlier context. condU 35M (10.9%) and condM 85M (13.0%) show clear improvement, consistent with scale enabling genuine retrieval.

### Ablation series (N=2048, 13M scale)

Six offset-set ablations on the condU 13M baseline, each changing one variable:

| Run | Key change | Test PPL | Passkey mean | Finding |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| condU baseline | V3 offsets, linspace init | 52.21 | 43.3% (5-sample) | Reference |
| Run C | Interleaved offset set | 52.86 | 45.0% (5-sample) | Fills d=32 gap; best custom passkey |
| Run D | Octave blocks, near-zero init | 55.49 | 35.0% (5-sample) | PPL penalty from sparse short-range |
| Run E | Dense 0-39, near-zero init | 52.44 | 25.0% (5-sample) | Best PPL of custom runs; passkey destroyed |
| Run F | Dense 0-15, gap 16-31, octave blocks | 52.73 | 21.7% (5-sample) | Cliff-edge commitment; gradient starvation |

Meta-finding: all six ablations failed to improve on the condU baseline simultaneously on both PPL and passkey. The V3 design (dense 0-31 + semi-dyadic long-range + linspace init) was near-optimal from physics derivation. The ablation series is mechanistic confirmation of why it works, not a search that found it.

### Layer position ablation (condM 13M)

| Full-attention layer position | Test PPL | Passkey mean | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Layer 0 | 70.08 | 8.3% | No preprocessing; uniquely bad |
| Layer 3 | 54.54 | 66.7% | Equivalent PPL; stronger OOD long-range |
| Layer 5 | 54.53 | 83.3% | Best passkey; direct output path |

Layer 0 is qualitatively different from layers 1-5. Layers 1-5 produce equivalent final PPL; the position only affects retrieval and long-range generalization. At least one preprocessing DSQG layer is required before full attention.

## Architecture

### DSQG offset set (V3, N=2048)

```
Dense local:    delta = 0, 1, 2, ..., 31          (32 offsets)
Semi-dyadic:    delta = 48, 64, 96, 128, 192,
                        256, 384, 512, 768,
                        1024, 1536               (11 offsets)
Total: 43 unique offsets (+1 for delta=0 self-attention)
```

Long-range offsets follow a semi-dyadic pattern (two taps per octave), giving maximum path diversity per offset budget. The dense 0-31 local window ensures the delta=1 copy attractor competes against 31 peers rather than dominating.

### DSQG attention (one layer)

```
QKV projection: x -> Q, K, V  [D x D, no bias]
For each offset delta in {0, 1, ..., 1536}:
    score[delta, h, n] = (Q[h, n] . K[h, n-delta]) / sqrt(d_head)
                       + pos_bias[delta, h]           # ALiBi-style learned bias
                       + Q[h, n] . scale_embed[delta]  # Q-weighted scale gain (condU only)
    [mask: delta > n positions set to -inf for causality]
weight = softmax(score) over 43 offsets
output = sum_delta weight[delta, h, n] * V[h, n-delta]
output = out_proj(attn_output * sigmoid(gate_proj(x)))  # gate bias init to 0
x = x + output
x = x + FFN(LayerNorm(x))
```

The gate bias is initialized to 0 (sigmoid output near 0.5 at init) to prevent early gate saturation. This is not "forced field retrieval" — the residual connection means information always bypasses through x regardless.

### condM interference (pooling layers)

```
pool = causal_mean(x)   # cumulative mean up to position n; O(N), vectorized
x += sigmoid(gate(x)) * proj(pool)
```

Adds distributional context from the sequence prefix to the residual stream. Model can suppress via gating.

### condU interference (Huygens K/V injection)

```
pool = causal_mean(x)
k_delta = inter_k_proj(pool)
v_delta = inter_v_proj(pool)
k = k + k_delta
v = v + v_delta
```

Injects prefix context directly into K and V, modifying what attention retrieves. Model cannot gate this out. Differs fundamentally from condM's residual addition.

### condU IF amplifier

```
if_gain: [num_heads]  # per-head scalar, ones-init
output_per_head *= if_gain[h]
```

Learned per-head gain normalization. At convergence: most-global heads (low pos_bias slope) amplify (gain > 1.0); most-local heads (high pos_bias slope) attenuate (gain < 1.0). Convergence is stable — gains freeze by epoch 7 of 10 and do not drift thereafter.

At 13M, final gains (50-sample, 10-epoch run):
```
h0 (most global): 1.030
h1:               1.026
h2:               0.994
h3:               0.987
h4:               0.947
h5:               0.946
h6:               0.970
h7 (most local):  0.949
```

### Layer stacks

**condM 85M** (D=640, H=8, d_head=80, L=12):
```
[DSQG, DSQG, DSQG+pool, DSQG, DSQG, DSQG+pool, DSQG, DSQG, DSQG+pool, DSQG, DSQG, Full]
```

**condU 13M** (D=256, H=8, d_head=32, L=6):
```
[DSQG, DSQG, DSQG+HK/V, DSQG, DSQG, Full]
```

**condU 39M** (D=512, H=8, d_head=64, L=6):
```
[DSQG, DSQG, DSQG+HK/V, DSQG, DSQG, Full]
```

**condU 85M** (D=768, H=12, d_head=64, L=8) — in training:
```
[DSQG, DSQG, DSQG, DSQG+HK/V, DSQG, DSQG, DSQG, Full]
```

### Inference KV cache

DSQG layers: circular buffer of depth max(offset) = 1,536 tokens per layer. Fixed size regardless of context length. For a 7B model at 100K context: standard attention ~52 GB KV cache; DSQG layers ~1.5 GB fixed.

The full causal attention layer retains a standard O(N) KV cache. For a purely O(1) deployment, this layer can be windowed at inference or replaced with DSQG at larger scales where per-layer retrieval capacity is sufficient.

## Key Findings

**Co-training is load-bearing.** The DSQG preprocessing advantage is zero at epoch 1 — all layer positions produce identical initial PPL. The full advantage emerges through joint training. Memory systems cannot be retrofitted onto pretrained backbones; the gradient pathway between provider and consumer must form from initialization. DeepSeek Engram finds the same constraint from the other direction.

**Content-gated routing is non-negotiable.** Without Q-K inner products at each offset (i.e., pure position-based routing), DWARF produces ~99 PPL. Adding full Q-K formulation dropped PPL by 14.3 in one change. This is the single most important architectural decision in the history of the project.

**PPL is insufficient to evaluate DSQG architectures.** Two documented cases: (1) condL collapsed to a delta=1 copy attractor while PPL was still improving; the collapse was visible in generation before PPL degraded. (2) condP at 65.1 PPL generates coherent sentences; standard 13M at 64.1 PPL (0.99 PPL better) generates severe word-level copy loops. Copy attractor exploitation inflates the standard transformer's PPL. Generation samples at every checkpoint are required.

**Distraction by density.** Dense local offsets (Run E: 0-39) give the model so many equivalent retrieval paths that no specific offset receives enough gradient to commit to long-range retrieval. The sparse semi-dyadic long-range structure forces selectivity. Run E had the best PPL of all ablations; it also had the worst passkey.

**Delta-effective metric.** For a passkey task with cue length C and intro tail T, the retrieval offset needed is delta_eff = d + C + T (not just d). V3's success at d=32 (60% passkey in Run C) was correctly predicted by verifying that delta=39 (= 32 + 5 + 2) is directly covered by the interleaved offset set. The aggregate path count metric is wrong; direct 1-hop delta_eff coverage is the correct predictor.

**Co-adaptive division of labor.** When a full attention layer co-trains with DSQG layers, the two systems spontaneously divide the retrieval task: full attention handles short-range, DSQG claims long-range. The boundary and specialization are not designed in; they emerge from gradient competition. Same principle as condM: the architecture must co-train for division of labor to form.

**IF gain specialization is monotonic and stable.** At 13M with 50-sample passkey measurement, per-head IF gains converge by epoch 7 to a smooth gradient from most-global (amplifying) to most-local (attenuating). The specialization does not drift after convergence. This is consistent with the IF amplifier physics: global heads need to amplify weak long-range signals; local heads can attenuate without loss.

**Scale changes the Pareto frontier.** At 13M, all architectures cluster within 1.6% on the 6-task benchmark suite regardless of PPL or passkey — the suite cannot distinguish memory mechanism types at small scale. The retrieval/PPL tradeoff becomes measurable at 35M+ and is a hard engineering constraint at 7B+ context lengths where O(1) KV cache is necessary.

## Training

All training uses FineWeb-Edu (sample-10BT) with the condI BPE tokenizer (36K vocab, 2048 sequence length). Token budget is Chinchilla-normalized per model size: each model is trained for 10 epochs with per-epoch sequence counts set so that epoch 7 approximately reaches 100% Chinchilla-optimal (20 x N tokens). This removes the tokens-per-parameter confound from cross-scale comparisons.

```
MAX_TRAIN_SEQS = int(20 * n_params / (7 * 2048))

13M:  19,611 seqs/epoch  [Chinchilla optimal at epoch 7]
39M:  54,031 seqs/epoch  [Chinchilla optimal at epoch 7]
85M: ~125,000 seqs/epoch [Chinchilla optimal at epoch 7; requires 300K docs]
```

Note: the ablation series (condM, condU, Runs A-F, condV, condW at 13M scale) used a fixed 52,716 seqs/epoch for all runs. These are valid comparisons within scale but are not Chinchilla-normalized. The 13M condU Chinchilla-normalized rerun (this README reflects its results) reproduces the original to within 0.03 PPL.

## Rust Verification

Mathematical properties of all architecture components are verified in Rust before training runs.

```bash
cd verification
PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH" cargo test --release -- --nocapture
```

182 tests pass. 3 known failures in `cond_d_db4` (KdV nonlinear instability — condD was an abandoned experiment; failures document its instability, not a bug).

Verified modules include: DSQG algebraic equivalence and causality, Huygens K/V injection, IF amplifier gain and SNR, coherent scale retrieval (Q-weighted matched filter), offset optimizer and delta-effective coverage metric, receiver chain interaction (heterodyne + AGC + PLL + Kalman), beamforming coherence, and full Run E/F offset-set analyses.
